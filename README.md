# Digital Destruction

As the player you control the hour and minute hand of an analog clock.

Digital clocks will begin to spawn from outside the screen. These will come from North, South, East, and West.
They will move towards the player controlled clock. The player must move the hour and minute hands of the analog
clock to match the time on the digital clock when they collide.

The speed of the digital clocks will increase over time.
