# Orbital Defender

You are the sole defender of a luminous planet. A bright light in a dark solar system, 
the planet attracts wave upon wave of cosmic bugs. You must zap these bugs into oblivion. 

Deep beneath the planet's crust there are rich ore deposits. Mining these will grant you 
wealth. Which can be exchanged for upgrades from the cosmic council. You will need these
in order to survive the onslaught.
